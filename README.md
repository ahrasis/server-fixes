# server fixes

I will compile some of my server install / build fixes in here.

# proxmox install on debian mate / lxde

Just make sure you first remove default qemu that comes with debian mate / lxde before you install and run proxmox install: "apt -f remove qemu-system-data". I may make a script but I don't think it is necessary for now.
